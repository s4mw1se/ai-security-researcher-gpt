# LLM Security Oracle

This repo is for the GPT "LLM Security Oracle". The goal of this project is to create a community-curated list of leading industry research that can be queried through the LLM Security Oracle. 

Feel free to create a PR if you would like research to be added or have suggestions for the prompt instructions. Prompt Engineering feedback is welcomed!

## I need help with the following:
1. Prompt Engineering of the GPT's instruction
2. Curating the documents so that the oracle can analyze industry-leading research related to LLMs
3. Document Optimizations - The more documents, the slower it responds. (good prompt engineering might be able to short-circuit some of this.
4. Analyzing PDFs for indirect prompt injections
